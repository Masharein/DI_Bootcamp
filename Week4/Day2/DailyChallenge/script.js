// Create an arrow function named displayGroceries, that console.logs the 3 fruits from the groceries object. Use the forEach method.

// Create another arrow function named cloneGroceries.
// In the function, create a variable named user that is a copy of the client variable. (Tip : make the user variable equal to the client variable)
// Change the client variable to “Betty”. Will we also see this modification in the user variable ? Why ?
// In the function, create a variable named shopping that is equal to the groceries variable.
// Change the value of the totalPrice key to 35$. Will we also see this modification in the shopping object ? Why ?
// Change the value of the payed key to false. Will we also see this modification in the shopping object ? Why ?

// Invoke the cloneGroceries function.
